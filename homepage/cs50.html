      <a class="dropdown-item cs50link xhov" href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50's Introduction To Computer Science</a>
      <p class="csdesc x">This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.</p>
      <a class="dropdown-item cs50link pyhov" href="https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python">CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python</a>
      <p class="csdesc py">An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.</p>
      <a class="dropdown-item cs50link aihov" href="https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python">CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</a>
      <p class="csdesc ai">This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, machine learning, large language models, and other topics in artificial intelligence as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By courseâ€™s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.</p>
      <a class="dropdown-item cs50link webhov" href="https://www.edx.org/learn/web-development/harvard-university-cs50-s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript">CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a>
      <p class="csdesc web">Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, you'll learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By course's end, you'll emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower you to design and deploy applications on the Internet.</p>
