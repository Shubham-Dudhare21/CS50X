if songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    We could use information from the songs database such as danceability, loudness, energy, valence and tempo to decide the aura of the user.
    we can get avarages of all the data as follows:
        energy          0.66
        danceability    0.72
        loudness        -5.68
        valence         0.48
        tempo           120

    According to spotify:
    Energy represents Intensity and Activity.
    Danceability represents How suitable a track is for dancing.
    Valence represents Musical Positiveness.
    Tempo represents Speed or Pace

    Generally songs with high valence are concidered positive(happy, cheerful, euphoric)
    Songs with low valence are more negative(sad, depressed, angry)

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    The database doesn't have any specified mood for the songs so the result is just an guess with the data available.
    In the given database the songs data is limited to only 100 songs so the audio aura might be incorrect.
